### **Future Enhancements & GUI Possibility**  

Yes! This CLI task manager can **absolutely** be extended into a **minimal GUI** while keeping its CLI functionality intact. 🚀  

---

## **✅ Future Enhancements (Short & Long Term)**
### **🔹 Short-Term Enhancements (CLI Improvements)**
- **`task reauth`** → Manual token refresh if needed.  
- **`task export`** → Save tasks/events as JSON, CSV, or Markdown.  
- **Task Dependencies** → Allow tasks to be linked (e.g., "Finish Report" depends on "Collect Data").  
- **Custom Reminders** → Set notification alerts for tasks (`task notify`).  
- **Advanced Filtering** → Query tasks/events using tags, priority, or natural language (`task list --priority high`).  

---

### **🔹 Long-Term Enhancements (Beyond CLI)**
#### **1️⃣ Minimal GUI (Desktop App)**
A **lightweight graphical interface** could be built on top of the existing CLI, using:
- **`Textual`** (for a terminal-based GUI) → Provides a **TUI (Terminal UI)** with panels, task lists, and interactive menus.  
- **`PyQt` or `Tkinter`** (for a simple desktop GUI) → Adds a **basic window-based interface** for task management.  
- **`Electron.js` or `Tauri`** (for a web-based desktop app) → If a **cross-platform GUI** is needed.  

✅ **Implementation Plan for GUI:**
1. **Wrap CLI functions in an API layer** (so both CLI & GUI can interact with the task manager).  
2. **Add a task list UI** with buttons for adding, editing, and completing tasks.  
3. **Keep offline mode working** by **syncing in the background** and showing cached data when offline.

#### **2️⃣ Mobile App**
- Could be built using **Flutter** or **React Native**.
- Syncs with the same task database as the CLI/GUI.
- Provides quick access to tasks and calendar events.  

---

#### **3️⃣ Web Dashboard**
- **FastAPI backend** to expose an API.
- **React/Next.js frontend** to manage tasks in a browser.
- Syncs with **Google Calendar & Microsoft To Do**.

### **Final Thought**
A **minimal GUI** (built with `Textual` or `PyQt`) would be the **most practical** next step without overcomplicating the project.  

Would you like a **basic prototype of a GUI** alongside the CLI? 🚀
